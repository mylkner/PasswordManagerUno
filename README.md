first ever app. kinda made it just to learn uno ig. pretty fun platform so far. will probably continue to use. 

didn't do a crazy amount of research or anything so not sure how goodit is. but the point was only to learn uno, not make an industry level app or anything.
overall good fun.

currently works on android and windows, haven't tested otheres. probably works on linux though too
